# tic-tac-toe
Tic tac toe kata for BNP Paribas Fortis.

To run the project, download or clone the repository, then open the .xcodeproj file in Xcode. Select a simulator or connected device and run the project.

Select "Begin Game" to start a game of tic-tac-toe with Player 1 (X) going first. Tap on an unoccupied space in the grid to place a mark for the current player there. The game is over when one player has a line of three of their marks on the board, or when all nine spaces have been filled (which ends the game in a draw).

Returning to the previous screen and choosing "Begin Game" will start a new game. This must be done when a game is finished (either through victory or a draw).

Note that due to a technical oversight, my name is included in some files and folders under `tic-tac-toe.xcodeproj`.
